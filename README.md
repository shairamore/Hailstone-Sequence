# Hailstone-Sequence
This is based on a problem from Douglas Hofstadter’s Pulitzer-prize-winning book Gödel, Escher, Bach. The hailstone process states that all numbers will eventually come down to 1. This is called the hailstone sequence.

> Pick some positive integer and call it n.
> If n is even, divide it by two.
> If n is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
> Continue this process until n is equal to one.

I made this code as part of my second assignment in Stanford University's Code in Place 2021.
